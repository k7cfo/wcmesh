West Coast Mesh is a decentralized **LoRa/Meshcore network** designed for reliable communication when traditional systems fail.  
No **cell service**, **Internet**, or **grid power** required — just long-range, encrypted text communication across a resilient mesh.

---

## 🚨 What It Does
- Enables **text messaging** between nodes up to miles apart  
- Operates **off-grid** using low-power LoRa radios  
- Automatically forms **mesh networks** with no central server  
- Offers **encryption and privacy** for sensitive operations  
- Works with solar, battery, or USB power sources  

---

## 🧭 Who It’s For
- **First Responders** – coordinate in blackouts or disaster zones  
- **Mission-Critical Teams** – maintain comms in remote or unstable areas  
- **Community Networks** – connect neighbors off-grid  
- **Privacy Advocates** – enjoy encrypted, decentralized communication  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Each node uses a LoRa radio (e.g., Meshtastic-compatible device).  
2. Devices broadcast and relay messages peer-to-peer.  
3. No single point of failure — every node extends the range.  
4. Optional gateways can connect to the wider network when available.

## ⚙️ Getting Started
- Visit [wcmesh.com](https://www.wcmesh.com) for setup guides and hardware recommendations.  
- Flash your LoRa device with the latest firmware.  
- Join your regional channel to start sending messages.  
- Optional: integrate with your community mesh or emergency team.

---

## 🔒 Encryption & Privacy
- End-to-end encrypted messages  
- Decentralized — no cloud dependency  
- Open participation, transparent operation  

---

## 🌎 Our Vision
To create a **resilient, self-healing communication grid** that empowers people to stay connected — no matter what happens to the infrastructure around them.
